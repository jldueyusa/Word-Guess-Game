# Welcome to the Hangman Game

The hangman game will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose with the goal of guessing the word before your number of guesses expire.
